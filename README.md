Created this website for skateboarding tips using basic HTML, CSS, and JS
NOTE: I won't be maintaining at ALL and also most tricks won't have information and I won't cover everything.
      I created only the basic outline for the entire website as practice.
Idea came to mind as I enjoy skateboarding and there isn't many skate tips website, so I decided to try and 
  code one up with in depth details and with a trendy frontend.
